            <h2>#FAQ'S</h2>
            <h4>Q) What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h4>
            <p>
                The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some
                patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or
                diarrhoea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
                (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out
                of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty
                breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood
                pressure, heazart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
                People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Q) Are elderly, children, women, pregnant women at higher risk of infection?</h4>
            <p>
                While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and
                persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart
                disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more
                often than others.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Q) Is it also transmitted through blood transfusion? Is it safe to donate or receive
                blood during Corona infection? </h4>
            <p>
                Individuals are not at risk of contracting COVID-19 through the blood donation process
                or via a blood transfusion, since respiratory viruses are generally not known to be
                transmitted by donation or transfusion.
